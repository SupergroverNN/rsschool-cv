          <p class="content">My name is Igor Shipulin. I'm Junior Frontend Developer. . In 2006, I was a student at the Lobachevsky University at the faculty of the VMK and decided to make my first website by writing it in a notebook, after reading 100 pages of a book on HTML. At that moment, I thought, "Who really needs this ?!" and abandoned this direction. After working for 11 years as a system administrator and having been the head of the IT department for several years, I decided to take javascript courses and felt the charm of programming again, but not in C, like at the university, but in javascript, which smoothly passed into react. Now I am developing my skills in this area and getting daily satisfaction from working in this field!</p>
